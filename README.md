### Project Description
Our project is a smart Chrome extension designed to improve focused learning and productivity. It tracks study time, allows users to highlight important text from any webpage, and instantly saves it to a personal Study Vault. With AI-powered summaries and organized notes, students can revise faster, stay consistent, and manage their learning efficiently — all without leaving their browser.

### The Problem statement
Students lose focus while studying online and struggle to organize highlighted content and track their study time in one place. Important information gets scattered across tabs and notes.

### The Solution
Our extension solves this by combining time tracking, quick saving, and smart summaries directly inside the browser.
